The code structure that prints all solutions of the N-Queens problem to the console.

N Queens Problem: The N-Queens problem that involves placing N chess queens on NxN chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. This means to two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal. The challenge is to find all possible solutions for a given N.

Note: If you change value of BOARD_SIZE macro, you can see all possible solutions of the problem , which base on the value, in the console.
